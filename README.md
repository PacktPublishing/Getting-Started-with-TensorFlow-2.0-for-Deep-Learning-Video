# Getting-Started-with-TensorFlow-2.0-for-Deep-Learning-Video

This is the code repository for [Getting Started with TensorFlow 2.0 for Deep Learning [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/getting-started-tensorflow-20-deep-learning-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Deep learning is a trending technology if you want to break into cutting-edge AI and solve real-world, data-driven problems. Google’s TensorFlow is a popular library for implementing deep learning algorithms because of its rapid developments and commercial deployments.
This course provides you with the core of deep learning using TensorFlow 2.0. You’ll learn to train your deep learning networks from scratch, pre-process and split your datasets, train deep learning models for real-world applications, and validate the accuracy of your models. 
By the end of the course, you’ll have a profound knowledge of how you can leverage TensorFlow 2.0 to build real-world applications without much effort.
